# 80s_heavy_metal_trivia
A trivia game about heavy metal from the 1980's 
If you answer 7 or more questions correctly you are rewarded with a nice compliment and a Judas Priest song
On the contrary less than 7 correct answers will succumb you to the humiliation of the Heathers laughing at you while you are forced to listen to Tiffany, the queen of mall pop
